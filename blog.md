Team Umberto Jack Asia Katie David - U-Jakd!


# Monday 10th February 2020 (David)

Today we were randomly assigned into the U-Jakd team! We first discussed when we would have stand-ups, retro's and then laid out a plan as to what we would hope to achieve by the time Wednesday mornings Sprint Demo takes place. We first mobbed - creating the github repo, slack channel and trello board. We then installed rails, discussed adding the necessary gems we would likely need, and added the continous integration (settling on using Travis!) Travis intergration proved tricky, we intally linked this to our repo, but then had some continued troubles with adding our herokou credentials. After much googling we found the answer, and have fully set up our CI and testing suite, the app is up and running on Herokou, and user stories were created and split up into individual tasks which the sub teams will tackle tomorrow.
